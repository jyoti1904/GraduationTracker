Hi,
Please find below changes i have made:
1. Code Refactoring: Created separate repositories, removed nested for loops with for each loops, lambda expression used, common functions moved to separate common class,
    interfaces created
2. Architectural changes: placed all common utilies inside 'Common' folder, all repositories inside 'Repositories' folder, all interfaces inside 'Contract' folder with sub folder for data contract.
3. Maximum test coverage
4. Used Moq for mocking repositories object for doing unit testing.

Thanks,
Jyoti
